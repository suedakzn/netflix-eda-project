# 🎬 Netflix Content Analysis (EDA Project)

This project presents a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Netflix dataset.  
The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in content types, genres, countries, ratings, durations, and temporal distributions using Python and data visualization libraries.

- 📆 Yearly and monthly addition patterns
- 🎯 Age ratings and audience targeting
- 🎭 Genre popularity and duration analysis
- ☁️ WordCloud of description themes
- 👨‍💼 Most active directors
- 📅 Day and month heatmaps for content release intensity

All insights are supported with **clean visuals**, **interpreted commentary**, and **actionable observations**.
